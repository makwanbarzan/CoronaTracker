# CoronaTracker

CoronaTracker is a free, open-sourced, online app for tracking COVID-19 outbreak cases based on countries. All data of this app has provided by [interactive-static.scmp.com](https://interactive-static.scmp.com) and will be updated daily.

Apple won't approve any coronavirus-themed apps created by individual developers, so I open-sourced this app and you can install to your physical phone and use it.
